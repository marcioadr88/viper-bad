## About VIPER

VIPER is an application of Clean Architecture to iOS apps. 

Clean Architecture is a software architecture pattern devised by Robert C. Martin in 2012 that promotes the SOLID principles of software design.

The word VIPER is a backronym for View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, and Routing. Clean Architecture divides an app's logical structure into distinct layers of responsibility.
